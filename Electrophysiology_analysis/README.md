## Extraction of the electrophysiological features

#### (A) Membrane potential responses of an example neuron to the consecutive step current injections.

#### (B) A series of membrane potential traces in response to hyperpolarizing current steps are fitted with an exponential function. The tau (t) is calculated for each trace.

#### (C) A box plot shows a series of Tau values from one sample neuron, including maximum (Max), minimum (Min), mean, median, the first quartile (Q1), the third quartile (Q3), the interquartile range (IQR) values. The Tau values falling above the upper range (> Q3+1.5*IQR) or below the low range (< Q1-1.5*IQR) are considered outliers and removed before averaging for the mean value. 

#### (D) The first hyperpolarizing trace in the step protocol used to calculate the sag ratio and rebound voltage as shown with inset equations. 

#### (E) The membrane potential responses to the last five negative current injections in the step protocol. The steady-state potential for each trace (Vss) is indicated with dash lines.  

#### (F) The steady-state potentials (Vss) are fitted with a linear function by the injected currents. The rest membrane potential (Vrmp) and input resistance (Rm) are calculated with the inset equation.  

#### (G) A representative trace with action potentials (AP) evoked during consecutive step current injections. Spike delay is defined as a time duration between two dash lines. 

#### (H) A representative AP trace (top) and its third derivative (dV/dt3, bottom). The AP threshold is the membrane potential where the third derivative of the AP trace is maximal, as indicated with a red dot. AP depolarization time, AP amplitude, AP repolarization time, AP half-width, and the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) amplitude are defined as shown with double-arrow lines and dash lines. 

#### (I) The membrane potential trace in response to 2x rheobase current injection. The initial (adaptation_index1) and last adaptation index (adaptation_index2) are calculated with inset equations after the interspike interval (ISI) between each AP is determined.
