Analysis of dual color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). 
(A) Top: A representative dual-color FISH staining image (merged). Green channel represents FITC-labeled RNA probe and red channel represents DIG-labeled RNA probe. Bottom: each cell with green and/or red signals detected with a custom-made IDL code, as indicated with a white dot.
(B) Top: A green signal-only staining image. Bottom: the image indicating the background green signals. It is derived by subtracting the signals of detected cells from the images on the top, smoothed by a 60 µm length window.
(C) Top: A red signal-only staining image. Bottom: the image indicating the background red signals. It is derived by subtracting the signals of detected cells from the images on the top, smoothed by a 60 µm length window.
(D) 2-D scatter plot of the intensity differences (dF) (Fn-F0) divided by F0 for each channel. Quadrilateral gates are drawn on the plot to determine whether a cell was single-labeled or double-labeled.
(E) The cell identities (Red+, Green+, Double+) are plotted with their spatial positions and 2-D density histograms are plotted through the anterior to posterior and dorsal to ventral axis to show the distribution of Red+, Green+, and Double+ cells along the two axises.
(F) Venn diagrams show the number of Red+, Green+, and Double+ cells in the images shown in A.
